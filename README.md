# Pet Breed Classifier

This is a Python implementation of a pet breed classifier.
It uses transfer learning from Deep Neural Networks that were trained on Imagenet.
A logistic regression is used to map the final layer.

## Getting Started

The program can be executed as a script from console.


### Prerequisites

Needs Tensorflow and several other libraries,
please see requirements.
It runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

## Running the tests

This project currently has no tests...
This is on my TODO list.

## Built With

Development tools

* [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Language runtime
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - IDE by JetBrains

Key Libraries

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - Deep Neural Network library
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) - Library that wraps Tensorflow (and other DNN libraries) and makes it easier to use
* [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Machine Learning library that is just great

Just to mention a few, see requirements.py for all libraries.
